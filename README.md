## Requirements

If you are going to implement your compiler in Python, here are the requirements:

* Python 3.6 or newer.
* llvmlite
* Clang C/C++ compiler.

One way to get llvmlite is to install the Anaconda Python
distribution.

## The Project

We are writing a compiler for the language [Wabbit](docs/Wabbit-Specification.md).
The following links provide more information on specific project stages.

* [Project 1 - The Model](docs/Project1_The_Model.md)
* [Project 2 - The Interpreter](docs/Project2_The_Interpreter.md)
* [Project 3 - The Lexer](docs/Project3_Tokenizing.md)
* [Project 4 - The Parser](docs/Project4_Parsing.md)
* [Project 5 - Type Checking](docs/Project5_Type_Checking.md)
* [Project 6 - Transformations](docs/Project6_Transformation.md)
* [Project 7 - Intermediate Representation](docs/Project7_IRCode.md)
* [Project 8 - Compile to LLVM](docs/Project8_Generating_LLVM.md)
* [Project 9 - Compile to WebAssembly](docs/Project9_Generating_WebAssembly.md)
